# WordPress Plugin - API Data Fetching and AI Chatbot Integration

## Overview

This WordPress plugin was developed during my internship at SiFAST, focusing on extending website functionality by fetching data from an external API and integrating AI-driven features. The main components of the plugin include:
- **API Data Fetching**: Fetching data from a specified API and displaying it on the WordPress site.
- **AI Chatbot**: A chatbot powered by the data fetched from the API to interact with users and provide useful information.

## Features

- Fetches data from an external API and displays it on your WordPress site.
- Implements a chatbot feature based on the data fetched, allowing users to interact with the site and receive relevant information.
- Customizable plugin options to modify API endpoints and chatbot behavior.

2. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory on your WordPress installation.
3. Go to the WordPress admin panel, navigate to "Plugins", and activate the plugin.

## Configuration

- **API Endpoint**: Configure the API endpoint in the plugin settings to fetch data from a specific source.
- **Chatbot Settings**: Customize the chatbot functionality via the plugin settings panel to modify the conversation flow based on the fetched data.

## Usage

Once activated, the plugin will automatically fetch data from the configured API and display it on your WordPress site. The chatbot will be available for user interaction, answering questions based on the fetched data.

1. Navigate to the page or section where you wish to display the data.
2. The chatbot will be available in the specified area for users to ask questions and get answers based on the API data.
